**Encapsulation**:
Allows grouping objects and methods together to reduce complexity.
"The best functions are ones with no parameters"

**Abstraction:**
Abstraction is when some of the properties and methods are hidden from the outisde.
Allows for the making of the interface is simpler and makes it easier to understand the methods and properties.
Allows us to reduce the impact of change where if a private method was changed on some day then that change won't directly change the outside.

**Inheritence:**
Its a mechanism that allows us to eliminate reduntant code.

**Polymorphism:**
A technique that allows us to get rid of long if and else statements.
